# Welcome to Your Jupyter Book Template

This is an example "book" to give you an idea for how Jupyter book content is structured.
Writing in Jupyter Book is just like writing in Jupyter Notebooks (although you can also add
markdown-only content), with the addition of additional markup features provided by
[MySt][myst]. 

```{important}
By default, all cells are run when building your book. If you would like to disable this feature
(which is recommended in some cases, e.g., when you're mixing languages in your notebook files),
files, change the `execute_notebooks` element to `off` in the _config.yml file.
```

See the [Jupyter Book documentation][jupyter_book] for more information about 
Jupyter Book-specific markup and content. For information about how Jupyter Notebooks/Jupyter
book interacts with atlas, see the [Atlas Documentation][atlas].

```{note}
This file will not appear included in the book in atlas, and can be safely left in the repository
and _toc.yml file. Feel free to rewrite its contents to suit your needs.
